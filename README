autoztool - automatic inline decompression tool
-----------------------------------------------

Autoztool contains a command called "z", which executes the command
found on its command line, in an environment in which compressed files
are automatically and mostly transparently decompressed when they are
opened for reading.

The intent is to use it with commands like less(1) to enable graceful
handling of compressed files (the zless wrapper has a much less
convenient multi-file interface).

Supported Systems
-----------------

Works for me on Debian GNU/Linux.
Works (possibly with some limitations) on OS X.

Installation
------------

To install in PREFIX:

  make prefix=PREFIX
  make prefix=PREFIX install         # as root if appropriate

If prefix is not overridden, /usr/local is assumed.
