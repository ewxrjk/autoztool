Description: Automatic inline decompression
  This package provides a command called "z", which executes the command
  found on its command line, in an environment in which compressed files
  are automatically and mostly transparently decompressed when they are
  opened for reading.
  .
  The intent is to use it with commands like less(1) to enable graceful
  handling of compressed files (the zless wrapper has a much less
  convenient multi-file interface).
